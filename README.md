# Linkester

Linkester is an Android library that aims to help Android developers test their deep links implementation.

The idea is to have a new launcher activity for your App (in debug builds) that will list all deep/app links available in your App and with a c lick on any of them you should be able to test it.

## Features
- Auto colelct all deep/app links.
- Manually add some deep links.
- Write any deep link and click on "try it out" button to see how your App will react.
- Long press on a deep link will auto fill it in the edit text box so that you can edit or add query params to the deep link before testing it.

## Getting started
1. To use Linkester, add the Linkester dependency to your appâ€™s build.gradle file:
	<details>
	<summary>Groovy</summary>

	```groovy
	dependencies {
	  // debugImplementation because Linkester should only run in debug builds.
	  debugImplementation 'com.mlegy.linkester:lib:<current_version>'
	}
	```
	</details>
	<details open>
	<summary>Kotlin</summary>

	```kotlin
	dependencies {
	  // debugImplementation because Linkester should only run in debug builds.
	  debugImplementation("com.mlegy.linkester:lib:<current_version>")
	}
	```
	</details>
2. There is 2 ways to list the deep links from your App into Linkester:

	1. Automatically collect all deep links from the App.
	To be able to let Linkester gather all your deep/app links automatically we only need to apply Linkester Gradle plugin into your project.

		#### Build script snippet for use in all Gradle versions:
		<details>
		<summary>Groovy</summary>

		```groovy
		buildscript {
		  repositories {
		    maven {
		      url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
		    }
		  }
		  dependencies {
		    classpath "gradle.plugin.com.mlegy.linkseter:plugin:<current_version>"
		  }
		}

		repositories {
		  mavenCentral()
		}

		apply plugin: "com.mlegy.linkseter"
		```
		</details>
		<details open>
		<summary>Kotlin</summary>

		```kotlin
		buildscript {
		  repositories {
		    maven("https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/")
		  }
		  dependencies {
		    classpath("gradle.plugin.com.mlegy.linkseter:plugin:<current_version>")
		  }
		}

		repositories {
		  mavenCentral()
		}

		apply(plugin = "com.mlegy.linkseter")
		```
		</details>

		#### Using new plugin API

		Build script snippet for new, incubating, plugin mechanism introduced in Gradle 2.1:
		```groovy
		plugins {
		  id "com.mlegy.linkseter" version "<current_version>"
		}

		repositories {
		  mavenCentral()
		}
		```
	2. Manually add your most common used deep links yourself.
	The second option you can use is to provide a json file with most common deep links in your app.
	You can do that by creating a raw json file in `res/values` the file must be named `linkester_manually_added_links.json`
	It should be a list of deep links where each link is an object of `title` and `link` fields
	Example:
		```json
		[  
		  {  
		    "title": "Home",  
		    "link": "https://app.melegy.com/home"  
		  },  
		  {  
		    "title": "Item details",  
		    "link": "https://app.melegy.com/list?id=12"  
		  }
		]
		```
